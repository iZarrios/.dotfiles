Hyprlandd + Arch setup

I did follow these steps and I struggled in getting the 'applications.menu' file, so I would like to share how I did solve the issue from this checkpoint.

First try running this command
kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental

If it does print this output -> "applications.menu" not found in QList("~/.config/menus", "/etc/xdg/menus"), you will need to get this file.
To get the applications.menu file, install this package
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-xdg-menu

Then run this command to generate the file
sudo update-desktop-database

As the file name differs you need to change the file name
cd /etc/xdg/menus

ls

expected output -> "arch-applications.menu"
sudo mv arch-applications.menu applications.menu

Then run again this command and it should work fine
kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental
